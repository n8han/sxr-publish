**First public release**: This [Simple Build Tool][sbt] plugin publishes annotated source files produced by the [Scala X-Ray][sxr] compiler plugin. It communicates with an  [Sxr Sourced][sxr-sourced] server using a simple shared secret protocol over HTTP: an HmacSHA1 signature of publish paths and file contents is attached to PUT requests in a `sig` parameter.

In order to work with the App Engine blobstore we had to change the sxr publishing API. You must upgrade to this version to continue to push annotated sources to [implicit.ly sourced][sourced].

[sourced]: http://sourced.implicit.ly/

* Can publish sources larger than 1 MB
* Publishes test sources in additon to main sources

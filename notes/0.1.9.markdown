A number of changes have been made to this plugin, [sxr-sourced][sxr-sourced], and [Scala X-Ray][sxr] to enable hyperlinks among separately published compilation modules. You can see an example of this in the [published source for the plugin][sxr-publish], which now links Dispatch calls to Dispatch sources.

Projects with submodules may have links between modules, and projects that depend on libraries whose sources are published may link to those. This linking *should be* automatic, but if the contents of the source repository have changed between preview and publishing runs you do need to `clean` to be sure the published sources reflect the current server contents.

- Depends on sxr 0.2.6
- Compresses `link.index` to `link.index.gz` before publishing
- Pulls `sxr.links` from server and filters by known / guessed dependencies before passing to sxr
- Passes a `base-directory` to sxr so its output will reflect the source directory structure
- Strips SNAPSHOT from any version name, so that in-progress versions will be published over when complete
